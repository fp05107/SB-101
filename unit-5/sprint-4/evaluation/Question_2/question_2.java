	 *         
	 *         1)One-to-one:-
	 *         ---------------
	 *         Example:- Suppose there is a table named TEAM
	 *                   and another table named CAPTAIN
	 *                   
	 *                   Here Each TEAM can have only one CAPTAIN 
	 *                   
	 *         Establishing Relationship:- Here we can refer CAPTAINID with TEAMs CAPTAINID
	 *                   
	 *                    
	 *

	 *                   
	 *                   Here in one DEPARTMENT more than one EMPLOYEE can work
	 *             
	 *         Establishing Relationship:- Here we can refer each deptid with empid.
	 *                  
	 *         3)Many-to-many:-
	 *         -----------------
	 *         Example:- Suppose there is a table named COURSE
	 *                   and another table named STUDENTS
	 *                   
	 *                   Here in each COURSE there can be more than one STUDENT and 
	 *                   each STUDENT can opt for more than one COURSE
	 *
