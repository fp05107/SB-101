/*
 * Runnable:-
 *      -> Runnable is a functional interface which is used to create a thread
 *      -> It has only abstract method run();
 *      -> Multiple threads share the same objects.
 *      -> Less memory required 
 *      -> If a class is implementing the runnable interface then your class can extend another class
 *      
 *Thread:-
 *      -> Thread is a class. It is used to create a thread 
 *      -> It has multiple methods including start() and run()
 *      -> Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it
 *      -> More memory required 
 *      -> Multiple Inheritance is not allowed in java hence after a 
 *         class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class
