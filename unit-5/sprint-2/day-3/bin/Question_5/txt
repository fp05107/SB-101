The join() method of a Thread instance is used to join the start of
 a thread’s execution to the end of another thread’s execution such

 thread will block until the Thread instance has finished executing. 
 The join() method waits at most this many milliseconds for this thread to die.
 A timeout of 0 means to wait forever
