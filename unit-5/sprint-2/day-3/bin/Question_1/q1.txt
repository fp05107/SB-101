SCOPE OF LOCK:-
----------------
One significant difference between the synchronized method and block is that 
Synchronized block generally reduces the scope of the lock. 
As the scope of a lock is inversely proportional to performance, 
it's always better to lock only a critical section of code. 

CONTROL OVER THE LOCK:-
-----------------------
Synchronized blocks provide granular control over a lock, as you can use arbitrary
any lock to provide mutual exclusion to critical section code. On the other hand,
the synchronized method always locks either on the current object represented by
this keyword or class level lock, if it's a static synchronized method.


3. NullPointerExcpetion:-
-------------------------
Synchronized block can throw java.lang.NullPointerException if 
expression provided to block as parameter evaluates to null,
 which is not the case with synchronized methods.
