3 sum 
Description

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Note: that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets..


Input
Input Format
The input consists of multiple testcases.

The first line of input contains an integer t - the number of testcases.

The next 2*t lines contain the description of the t testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains an integer n, the size of the array nums.

The second line of each testcase contains n space separated integers nums[0],nums[1]....nums[n-1] denoting the n elements of the nums array.

Constraints
1 <=t<= 100

1 <=n<= 1000

-10^4 <=nums[i]<= 10^4


Output
Output Format
For each testcase output first the number of such triplets, followed by each triplet on a new line,where the triplets are in sorted order, i.e. both the individual triplet and the the overall output should be sorted.


Sample Input 1 

1
6
-1 0 1 2 -1 -4
Sample Output 1

2
-1 -1 2
-1 0 1
Hint

First testcase
There are only two unique tripplets possible such that their sum is 0.
