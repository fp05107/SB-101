Pattern Printing - Rhombus Ended
Description

A Rhombus is a flat shape with 4 equal straight sides. A rhombus looks like a diamond. All sides have equal length. Opposite sides are parallel, and opposite angles are equal (it is a Parallelogram)

Given a digit n, form a rhombus.

The rules for forming the rhombus are:

- n should be present in the centre of the rhombus

- digits should decrease as they approach the edges of rhombus

For example, for n = 5 the pattern should look like shown below:

You have to write a program that prints a pattern for a given value of n


Input
Input Format

The first line contains the single integer n

Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 9


Output
Print a picture for the given n. You should strictly observe the number of spaces before the first digit on each line.

Every two adjacent digits in the same line should be separated by exactly one space.

There should be no spaces after the last digit at the end of each line.
