Walk in the Park 
Description

Given a 2d array with 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R' representing up, down, left, right => 
count the number of steps you have taken before reaching an already visited cell 
or going outside the 2d array.

Note: The first step is always taken to cell located at (0,0).


Input
The first line of the input contains T, the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains N, and M, the number of rows, and columns in the 2D Array.

The next lines of the test case, contains M characters each, denoting the values in the 2D array.

Constraints

1 <= T <= 10

1 <= N,M <= 100


Output
Print a single integer, denoting the number of steps, you take before 
stepping out of the 2D array, or visiting an already visited cell, on a new line.

Sample Output 1

4
Hint

In the first sample test case, the first jump as given in the problem statement,
 is taken at (0,0), and the next jump is taken at (0,1) as the value in the 
 cell is R, followed by another jump  right at (0,2). At (0,2) the value in the cell is D, 
 therefore, a jump down is made at the point (1,2) which has a value of 'U', so the jump is 
 made back to an already visited cell, (0,2). Therefore, we stop at this point, making the 
 total number of steps taken as 4, before visiting an already visited cell, or going out of the 2D array.
